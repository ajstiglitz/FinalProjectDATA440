### FinalProjectDATA440 Project Overview
---

### Description
The purpose of this code is to create a Graphical User Interface (or GUI) for 


what needs to be included here:
- should be focused on high-level overview 
- contain instructinos for others to use the code
- the writeup (which will be in a different folder) will have the additional background, more details about the data and methods, and discuss other conclusions/future work where applicable
- in my case the data will be about the math behind the plots and the advantage in terms of the distribution of max(X, x)
- file in folder for 'writeup' is just a placeholder to make it appear on git. shows the math i did by hand before coding


What needs to be moved from the main repository into folders:
- tabonetest.py
- tabtwotest.py
- tabthreetest.py
- style.qss
    - might need to remove the style.qss and go into the widgets to add style, since it is not looking how I want.

NOTE: will need to remember to refactor the files when moved otherwise it won't work anymore

What needs to be added
- a saved graph into figures

What needs to be deleted:
- the D20Pygame.py
- the 'Dice' Folder
- 'data' folder also probably can be deleted. I am using arrays and not a .csv to read in the dice for the plot
